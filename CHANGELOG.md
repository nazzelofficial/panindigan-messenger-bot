## [2.12.4] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **Anti-Toxic Command** - Added new `antitoxic` admin command to easily block all inappropriate and toxic words in the group.
  - **Usage**: `antitoxic on` to enable, `antitoxic off` to disable.
  - **Integration**: Fully integrated with the core moderation system (`BadWordsFilter`) for consistent enforcement.
  - **Coverage**: Blocks a comprehensive list of Filipino and English profanity.

## [2.12.3] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **Anti-Spam System** - Fixed a critical bug where the rate limit counter would never reset if messages were sent continuously.
  - **Infinite Blocking Fixed**: Rate limit counters now properly expire 60 seconds after the *first* message, preventing infinite accumulation.
  - **Optimized Limits**: Increased default limits to 60 messages/minute (1 per second) and reduced global cooldown to 1s.
  - **Owner Bypass**: Bot owners are now completely exempt from all rate limits and cooldowns.

## [2.12.2] - 2026-02-08

### Changed

#### Security & Moderation
- **Strict Non-AI NSFW Detection** - Replaced AI-based (nsfwjs) detection with a strict algorithmic skin tone detection system.
  - **Pixel-Level Analysis**: Scans every pixel for skin tone patterns (RGB/HSV rules).
  - **Zero Tolerance**: Automatically deletes images/videos with >30% skin content.
  - **Video Thumbnail Scanning**: Now scans video thumbnails for restricted content.
  - **Unsend First Policy**: Immediately unsends restricted messages before sending a warning to minimize exposure.
  - **Performance**: Significantly faster detection with lower memory usage (no large model loading).
- **Environment Security** - Added `APP_STATE` environment variable support for secure runtime session injection (Koyeb/Docker).

#### Infrastructure
- **Node.js Upgrade** - Upgraded project compatibility to Node.js v23 (Alpine) for better performance and security.
- **Dependency Optimization** - Removed unused postinstall scripts and optimized build process.

### Fixed

- **Database Connection** - Improved connection logic to support both `DATABASE_URL` and `POSTGRES_URL`, with detailed logging for connection failures to help debugging.
- **Anti-NSFW Persistence** - Fixed an issue where the Anti-NSFW setting would reset to "OFF" after a bot restart due to data type mismatch (Boolean vs String) in PostgreSQL.
- **Thread Persistence** - Fixed an issue where threads were not being saved to the database upon message receipt, causing empty threads table.
- **Redis Removed** - Completely removed Redis dependency. All caching, rate limiting, and cooldowns are now handled natively by PostgreSQL (`settings` table with expiry) and in-memory fallback.
- **Database Schema** - Added `expires_at` column to `settings` table to support TTL-based keys (replacing Redis).

### Removed
- **Redis** - Removed `ioredis` dependency and `REDIS_URL` configuration requirement.

## [2.8.1] - 2025-12-09

### Changed

#### Hosting Platform Support (restart & shutdown)
Commands now work properly on all hosting platforms: Koyeb, Railway, Heroku, Replit, VPS, Local, etc.

**restart command:**
- Clean exit with `process.exit(0)` - hosting platforms auto-restart
- Clears any shutdown flag before exiting
- Works on: Koyeb, Railway, Heroku, Replit, any hosting with auto-restart
- Properly disconnects Redis and MongoDB before exit

**shutdown command:**
- Sets `bot_shutdown` flag in MongoDB before exiting
- Bot checks this flag on startup and refuses to start
- Stays OFFLINE until redeployed or FORCE_START=true env is set
- Perfect for maintenance or taking bot offline
- Requires confirmation: `shutdown confirm`

#### Shutdown Flag System
- Bot startup checks for `bot_shutdown` flag in database
- If flag is true, bot stays in idle state (process alive but bot inactive)
- To restart after shutdown:
  1. Redeploy on hosting platform (clears the flag automatically)
  2. Or set `FORCE_START=true` environment variable
- Prevents unwanted auto-restarts after intentional shutdown

### Fixed
- **kick.ts** - Removed 'remove' alias (conflicted with removeall), only 'kick' and 'boot' now
- **removeall.ts** - Protects ALL admins (group admins will NOT be kicked)
- **restart.ts** - Now properly restarts on any hosting platform
- **shutdown.ts** - Now stays offline until manual redeploy

### Technical
- New database settings: `bot_shutdown` (boolean), `bot_shutdown_time` (ISO string)
- Startup check in main.ts for shutdown flag
- FORCE_START environment variable support to override shutdown flag

---

## [2.8.0] - 2025-12-09

### Added

#### Owner & Admin List System with Dual Verification
- **ownerIds** - Array in config.json for bot owner(s) - full access to all commands
- **adminIds** - Array in config.json as whitelist for bot admins
- **Dual Requirement for Admins** - Users must be BOTH in adminIds list AND a Facebook group admin to use admin commands (prevents abuse)
- **Permission Utility Module** - New `src/lib/permissions.ts` with centralized permission checking functions

### Changed
- **Permission System** - Completely redesigned with tiered permissions:
  - **Owner commands**: Only users in OWNER_ID env or config.bot.ownerIds can execute
  - **Admin commands**: Must be owner OR (in adminIds list AND Facebook group admin)
  - This prevents abuse - being in the config list alone is not enough
- **Locked Group Access** - Only owners and verified group admins can access
- **Maintenance Mode** - Only owners can bypass maintenance mode

### Security Improvements
- Admin commands now require dual verification (config whitelist + group admin status)
- Prevents abuse from leaked config or rogue group admins
- Centralized permission logic reduces code duplication and potential bugs

### Technical
- New file: `src/lib/permissions.ts` with helper functions:
  - `isOwner(userId)` - Check if user is bot owner
  - `isInAdminList(userId)` - Check if user is in admin whitelist
  - `isThreadAdmin(userId, threadAdminIds)` - Check if user is Facebook group admin
  - `canExecuteAdminCommand(userId, api, threadId)` - Full admin permission check
  - `canAccessLockedGroup(userId, api, threadId)` - Locked group access check
- Refactored commandHandler.ts and main.ts to use permission utilities
- Cleaner, more maintainable permission code

### How to Configure
1. Add your Facebook User ID to `config.json` under `bot.ownerIds` - you get full access
2. Add trusted user IDs to `bot.adminIds` - they can use admin commands ONLY in groups where they are also Facebook group admins
3. Example:
```json
{
  "bot": {
    "ownerIds": ["YOUR_FACEBOOK_ID"],
    "adminIds": ["TRUSTED_USER_1", "TRUSTED_USER_2"]
  }
}
```

**Permission Flow:**
- Owner-only commands (restart, shutdown, eval, etc.) → Only ownerIds
- Admin commands (kick, ban, announce, etc.) → Owner bypasses, others need to be in adminIds AND group admin

---
